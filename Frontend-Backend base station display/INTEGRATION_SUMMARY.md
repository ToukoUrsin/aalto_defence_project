## Layout Structure:

```
Header (Tactical Ops Dashboard)
├── Summary Button
└── Unit Level Selector

Main Content Grid
├── Sidebar (1/4 width)
│   └── Active Units (Soldier Selection)
│
└── Main Area (3/4 width)
    ├── Live Reports Stream (StreamPanel)
    ├── Raw Voice Inputs (from backend API)
    └── AI-Generated Reports (from backend API)

Overlays
├── Report Drawer (right sidebar)
└── Summary Modal (center)
```

## How to Run:

1. Navigate to the mil_dashboard directory:

   ```bash
   cd mil_dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies (already running):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Backend Requirements:

The dashboard expects the backend API to be running at `http://localhost:8000` with these endpoints:

- `GET /soldiers` - List all soldiers
- `GET /soldiers/{id}/raw_inputs` - Get soldier's raw voice inputs
- `GET /soldiers/{id}/reports` - Get soldier's AI-generated reports

## Key Improvements:

- **Unified Interface**: Single dashboard for both soldier monitoring and battlefield reports
- **Enhanced UX**: Interactive components with smooth animations and transitions
- **Better Visualization**: Charts and organized data display
- **Professional Styling**: Military-themed dark UI with neumorphic design
- **Modular Architecture**: Reusable UI components following shadcn/ui patterns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout

## Next Steps (Optional):

1. Connect report stream to real backend data instead of mock data
2. Add real-time WebSocket updates for live report streaming
3. Implement actual report generation in Summary Modal
4. Add filtering and search capabilities
5. Add export functionality for reports
6. Implement user authentication and role-based access
