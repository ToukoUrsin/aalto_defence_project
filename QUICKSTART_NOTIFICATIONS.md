## üêõ If You Still See Errors:

### Check Backend Logs

Look for errors in the terminal where backend is running. Common issues:

1. **"table suggestions has no column..."** ‚Üí Database not migrated

   ```powershell
   Get-Content add_suggestions_table.sql | sqlite3 military_hierarchy.db
   ```

2. **"Port 8000 already in use"** ‚Üí Old backend still running

   - Find and kill the process
   - Or use a different port

3. **Import errors** ‚Üí Missing dependencies
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\pip install fastapi uvicorn paho-mqtt google-generativeai
   ```

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed:

- ‚úÖ Made `analyze_report_triggers()` synchronous (was async)
- ‚úÖ Made `create_suggestions()` synchronous (was async)
- ‚úÖ Removed `await` calls from sync endpoint
- ‚úÖ Database schema applied
- ‚úÖ API endpoints added

The 500 errors were caused by calling async functions from a non-async endpoint. Now fixed!
