Refined Tech Stack & Pipeline Suggestions
Here are component-by-component suggestions to increase your speed and chances of winning.

1. Soldier Device (Raspberry Pi) - The Edge
Your plan is good, but let's make it more robust and demo-friendly.
Speech-to-Text (ASR): Keep Python, but use VOSK.
Why: Whisper is fantastic but can be heavy and slow on a Raspberry Pi, even tiny models. VOSK is designed for exactly this use case: lightweight, offline, and fast on low-power devices. It's a specific technology mentioned in the challenge description, which shows the judges you paid attention.
Metadata: Hardcode most of it.
Don't waste time trying to get real GPS working, especially given the "GPS spoofed" constraint. For the demo, have a simple config file on the Pi: unit_id = "Alpha-3" and location = "Hardcoded Grid 123-456". This is all about feasibility.
2. Messaging & Gateway - Simplify Radically
Your gateway idea is correct for a real-world system, but it's a time sink in a hackathon.
Suggestion: Collapse the Gateway into the HQ.
Have the Raspberry Pi connect directly to a WiFi hotspot hosted by your "HQ" laptop.
Run the Mosquitto MQTT broker directly on the laptop that's also running your backend.
Why: This removes an entire component (the separate gateway service), reduces network complexity to zero, and saves you hours of debugging. You can simply talk about the store-and-forward capability in your presentation.
3. HQ Backend & AI Core - The "Magic" Happens Here
This is where you score the most points for Uniqueness.
Backend: Keep FastAPI and SQLite. Perfect choices for speed.
AI Pipeline: Use LangChain and an API-based LLM.
Do not run Llama locally unless you have a very powerful machine and experience with it. It will be slow and a distraction.
Use the GEMINI api (or Groq for incredible speed) for the hackathon. It's reliable, fast, and lets you focus on the logic, not the infrastructure. Just state in your presentation that the model can be swapped for a locally hosted, fine-tuned one like Llama.
Implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline. This is a key requirement.
Create a simple text file (doctrine.txt) with examples of how to format a CASEVAC or EOINCREP report.
When a soldier's message comes in, use LangChain to "retrieve" the relevant section from your doctrine.txt.
Feed both the soldier's text and the doctrine example into the LLM.
The Killer Prompt: Your prompt is everything. Use a structure like this:
"You are a military AI operations assistant. Your task is to convert unstructured voice reports from the field into a specific, structured JSON format.

**Retrieved Doctrine on EOINCREP formatting:**
{retrieved_doctrine_text_here}

**Incoming Field Report:**
"Unit Alpha-3 reports seeing an enemy vehicle north of the road. Looks like a T-72 tank."

**Instructions:**
Using the provided doctrine and the field report, generate a formal EOINCREP report in the following JSON format. Infer any missing details and flag them with a low confidence score. Extract key entities like unit, location, and threat type.

**JSON Output:"


Structured Output: Use Pydantic. The challenge explicitly mentions this. Use LangChain's PydanticOutputParser to force the LLM's output into a clean, predictable JSON schema. This is a huge technical win. It shows you know how to build reliable AI systems and makes connecting to your frontend trivial.
4. Dashboard - Minimum Viable Visualization
Don't overcomplicate this. The goal is to show the result, not to build a full C2 platform.
Suggestion: Next.js.
Your UI only needs two things:
A small text area showing the raw, incoming transcribed messages from MQTT.
A formatted text block or JSON viewer showing the structured report generated by the AI.
This side-by-side view is the most powerful part of your demo.







Challenge Details
Make AI and robotics work with the modern warfighter – on the frontline!
Introduction
Every order, every gesture, every sensor ping can save or cost lives at the point of contact. What The Warfighter? is a defence hack where you turn raw ideas into battlefield solutions. Join Milrem and Millog to build the tools warfighters need right now on the fronts of Ukraine. Will your prototype make a difference on the battlefield?

Challenge detaiils
Path 1 AI for Front and Rear: Turn raw, unstructured battlefield inputs into crystal- clear decisions and support the fighters with maintenance or repair tasks. Can you build a generative AI copilot that can ingests chat logs, sensor snippets, and doctrine to draft 5-paragraph OPORD/FRAGO and standard reports (EOINCREP, CASEVAC) with citations and confidence flags, then translates them between NATO, national, and machine-readable schemas so people and robots share one picture using low-bandwidth. On the edge, vision models (e.g., Segment Anything + lightweight classifiers) run to convert images into tiny text alerts instead of streaming video. The same stack includes a small-language-model maintenance assistant that runs locally to guide step-by-step repairs and troubleshooting, recording actions and syncing compressed deltas when a trickle of comms returns. Everything must function when GPS is spoofed, and bandwidth is near zero and securely reconcile with C2/maintenance systems the moment connectivity reappears. Potential solutions to look into:

Edge vision
LLM + RAG pipelines
Segment Anything
Speech recognition toolkit (e.g. VOSK)
Object detection models (e.g. YOLOv8)
Model optimization & inference speedup in low-power or constrained devices (e.g. TensorRT)
Frameworks to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines
Enforce structured, schema-compliant outputs (e.g Pydantic)
Equipment
Logitech C270 Web cameras

Raspberry Pi's

Mission planning and higher-level logic can also be implemented in a game engine (e.g., Unity or Unreal Engine), allowing teams to quickly model and test their scenarios.
